# Security Policy

myPKA is a **local-first, single-user, markdown folder**. It has no server, no
account, no database of ours, and no telemetry. It runs on your machine, under
your LLM tool, on files you own. That shape is the security model, and most of
this page follows from it.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 5.4.x | Yes. Current release line. |
| < 5.4.0 | Not supported. Security fixes ship on the current line only; update to receive them. |

If you report something against an older version, we will tell you whether it
affects the version you are on.

Security fixes land on the current minor line. `manifest.json` `scaffold_version`
is the single source of truth for what you are running; `VERSION` and
`.scaffold-version` mirror it.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Report privately. Do not open a public issue for an unfixed vulnerability.**

Use **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** on this repository: the Security
tab, then "Report a vulnerability". It is private between you and the
maintainers, and it is the only channel we monitor for security reports.

Please include the affected version (from `manifest.json`), what you observed,
how to reproduce it, and the impact you think it has. A proof of concept helps
and is not required.

Do not send vulnerability reports to our general support address. It is a
product-support channel, it is not access-controlled for security material, and
it is not monitored for security reports.

**What to expect.** We are a small team, so here is the honest version. We aim to
acknowledge a report within 5 working days and to give you an initial assessment
within 10. These are targets we work to, not a contractual response time, and we
would rather state them plainly than publish a guarantee we cannot staff around
the clock. If you have not heard from us after 10 working days, send a follow-up
on the same report thread and treat that as a nudge rather than a closed door.

Coordinated disclosure is the default: we agree a fix timeline with you, ship the
fix, and credit you in the release notes if you want credit. Please give us a
reasonable window before public disclosure. Our target is 90 days from your
report, shorter when the fix is simple, and we will tell you if something is
going to take longer rather than going quiet.

We do not run a paid bug bounty.

## Scope

**In scope**

- The scaffold's own scripts: `scripts/update-scaffold.py`, `scripts/check-version.py`,
  `validation-script.sh`, and the scripts under `Team Knowledge/scripts/`.
- The framework and user-state path boundary in `manifest.json`. A path that lets
  an update bundle write outside `framework_paths`, or write anything under
  `user_state_paths`, is a vulnerability and we want to hear about it.
- The bundled myPKA Cockpit at `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/`. It has its own, more
  detailed policy at `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/SECURITY.md`; report Cockpit
  issues through the same channel above.
- Anything in a published release artifact that should not be there: a credential,
  a private path, a key of any kind.

**Out of scope**

- Your own vault contents, your notes, and anything your LLM tool does with them.
  The scaffold is text on disk; it does not execute your notes.
- Third-party Expansions you install, and third-party MCP servers you register.
  `Expansions/README.md` states this: an Expansion is someone else's code that you
  chose to run. We do not vet, audit, sandbox, or accept authorial responsibility
  for third-party Expansions.
- Your LLM provider, your LLM tool, and your operating system.
- Prompt injection against your own LLM through content you deliberately imported.
  Treat imported content as untrusted, the same as you would in any other tool.
- Derivative scaffolds distributed by other people. `DERIVATIVES.md` permits them
  and they inherit this file by default. Report issues in a derivative to whoever
  distributes it. We can only fix what ships from this repository.
- Instructions carried by third-party Expansions. An Expansion's `AGENTS.md` and
  its prose are instructions your assistant will follow, and that is the same
  "someone else's code you chose to run" boundary as above. Injection through the
  scaffold's OWN shipped markdown is in scope and we want to hear about it.
- The derived `mypka.db` mirror and any local embedding store. They are generated
  from your own markdown, they live only on your machine, and they are
  regenerable. Markdown is canonical.
- Automated scanner output with no demonstrated impact, missing security headers,
  denial of service and volumetric testing, and social engineering of the team or
  our support channels.
- The myICOR web application and its infrastructure. Different asset, different
  policy; use the contact address below and we will route it.

## What the scaffold does over the network

Exactly one thing, and it is worth knowing precisely.

`scripts/check-version.py` makes a single read-only HTTPS GET for one plain-text
version string, at most 64 bytes, with a 3 second timeout, and fails silent when
offline. It sends no vault contents, no filenames, no identifiers, and no
telemetry. It never downloads or applies anything. The destination is declared in
`manifest.json` under `update_check.remote_version_url` and the disclosure text
sits next to it. Set `update_check.enabled` to `false` to turn it off.

`scripts/update-scaffold.py` makes **no** network call at all. It works on an
update bundle already on your disk, is dry-run by default, and fails closed: it
refuses any path outside the `framework_paths` allow-list, refuses any path an
update bundle declares inside `user_state_paths`, refuses to write outside the
scaffold root, and backs up any framework file you have locally modified before
overwriting it.

The word "declares" in that second guarantee is deliberate: the allow-list and
user-state checks are applied to the path the bundle asks for, while root
containment is applied to the path the write actually lands on. Tightening the
user-state check the same way is the first item in 5.4.1, tracked in the open
under "Known issues" in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Nothing else in the scaffold core reaches the network.

## Standing distribution rules (release-blocking)

These apply to every release of the scaffold and to every Expansion, connector,
or pack built on it. A release that breaks one of these does not ship.

### Keys never leave the user's machine (bring your own key)

- Anything that talks to an LLM provider is **bring your own key**. Each user
  supplies their own key. It is read from that user's local environment or
  config, held in memory locally, and **never** pooled, proxied, centrally
  stored, or reused across users.
- A frontend never calls a provider API directly. It calls the local server on
  `localhost`, and only that.
- Routing multiple users through one key, or through consumer subscription
  credentials, is an outright provider Terms of Service violation and is
  prohibited outright, not discouraged.
- **No key of any kind ships in any artifact.** Not in a release ZIP, not in a
  manifest, not in an example file, not in a commit.

### Secrets by reference, never by value

- API keys and tokens live in `Team Knowledge/.env` (gitignored, file mode
  `0600`) or in an Expansion's own `.env`. `.env` at any depth is gitignored;
  `.env.example` is the only committed form.
- Code resolves a secret by key **name** at the point of use. A secret value must
  never appear in a route response, a log line, an error message, a session-log
  entry, a derived database, or a commit.
- `expansion.yaml` declares secrets as `env_vars` with `sensitive: true`. It never
  contains a secret value.

### Release integrity

- Release artifacts are built deterministically and the ZIP sha256 is published on
  the release page, so any downloader can verify the bytes they received.
- CI holds no service-role key and no database credential. The release pipeline
  talks to a single edge function with a shared secret and uploads through
  short-lived signed URLs.
- Official Expansions are hash-pinned in `Expansions/.trusted-sources`, and release
  CI blocks a release whose bundled Expansion does not match its pin. The
  install-time check that compares an Expansion's manifest hash against those pins
  is carried out by the install workstream, which your assistant executes; it is an
  assistant-enforced gate, not a compiled one. Treat it as a strong default rather
  than a sandbox.

## If you are distributing your own version

You may. See `DERIVATIVES.md`. Two security-relevant points from it, repeated here
because they are the ones people miss:

- **Re-point or disable `update_check`.** A derivative that leaves it pointed at
  the upstream repository will have upstream framework files written over the
  derivative's own by any user who follows the update prompt.
- **Delete `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/`** before you distribute. It is separately
  licensed and is not yours to redistribute.

## Safe harbour

If you research in good faith, act only against your own installation, avoid
privacy violations and service disruption, give us reasonable time to fix what you
find, and do not exfiltrate or destroy data, we will not pursue legal action
against you and we will treat your report as authorised.

This applies to your own installation and to this repository's code. It does not
authorise testing against third-party services (your LLM provider, GitHub, or the
myICOR web application), and we cannot waive anyone else's rights on their behalf.
If you go outside these bounds, the safe harbour does not apply to that activity.
